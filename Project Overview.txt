Project OverviewThis project applies auto-sklearn, an automated machine learning library, to predict antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from transcriptomic data of bacteria. The goal is to utilize gene expression profiles to determine the resistance of bacterial strains to various antibiotics.
Data Preparation
Data Sources* Resistance Data: Contains Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for different antibiotics.* Expression Data: Includes gene expression levels across multiple bacterial strains.Preprocessing Steps
1. Initial Cleanup: Irrelevant columns are dropped from both datasets to ensure consistency and relevance in features.2. Feature Selection: Focuses on key genes previously identified in literature (e.g., Suzuki et al. or Sastry et al.) for their roles in antibiotic resistance.3. Data Alignment: The expression matrix is transposed so each row corresponds to a sample and each column to a gene.
Binary Classification Setup* MIC values are converted into binary labels (resistant or susceptible), simplifying the model's target and enhancing the interpretability of results.Machine Learning Model* Model Training: Utilizes auto-sklearn for automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning.* Validation Strategy: Employs stratified k-fold cross-validation to maintain balanced class distribution.* Scoring Metrics: Includes ROC-AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall to evaluate model performance comprehensively.Model Evaluation and Statistics* Performance Summary: Post-training, the model's performance is assessed using various metrics, and a detailed leaderboard of the best models is generated.* Model Export: Trained models are saved using joblib for later use in predictions or further analysis.Predictions and Final Scoring* The final model is employed to predict the resistance labels of the test set and accuracy and F1-score are calculated to quantify the model's effectiveness.Adaptability and Customization* Gene Adaptation: The gene set can be adjusted based on new research or different organisms to tailor the model to specific resistance mechanisms.* Antibiotic Flexibility: The target labels can be modified to include new antibiotics or different resistance profiles, making the framework versatile across various microbial and treatment contexts.
